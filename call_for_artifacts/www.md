# Call for Artifact Badging

We invite authors of **accepted** papers in all tracks of The Web Conference to apply for the "Artifacts Available" badge in the ACM Digital Library and on the conference website.

We would like to encourage sharing, discovery, and reuse of artifacts, such as datasets, ML models, software associated with the conference papers. At this stage, we welcome submissions only from **accepted** papers. The artifact submissions will undergo a light review and will be awarded with “Artifacts Available” badge in the ACM Digital Library.

#### Important Dates

Submission deadline: submit your artifacts at the same time as the camera-ready version of your paper.

-   Main Proceedings: February 18, 2024
-   Companion Proceedings: March 11, 2024

All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone.

#### Scope

We welcome submissions of artifacts used or produced by accepted papers in all tracks of the main or companion proceedings of The Web Conference 2024, excluding workshop papers.

#### Submission Guidelines

You can apply for the “Artifacts Available” badge if you release a new dataset, new code, or a similar artifact associated with your paper. Authors of accepted papers will receive a link to submit their artifacts.

Additional requirements:

-   You must host the artifact in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts
    
-   The artifact must have unique dereferenceable identifiers, such as a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Most archival research repositories provide DOIs (e.g., Zenodo, Kaggle, Figshare, DataDryad, etc.).
    

#### Reviewing Process

A conference review committee of volunteers will verify that artifacts are indeed available in a publicly accessible archival repository at the link that you specify.
